// Develop a Java application that will input the miles driven and gallons used (both as integers) for each trip. 
// The program should calculate and display the miles per gallon obtained for each trip and print the combined miles per gallon 
// obtained for all trips up to this point. All averaging calculations should produce floating-point results. Use class Scanner 
// and sentinel-controlled repetition to obtain the data from the user.
