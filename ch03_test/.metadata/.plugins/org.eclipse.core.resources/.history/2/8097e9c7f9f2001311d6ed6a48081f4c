// Create a class called Invoice 
// An Invoice should include four pieces of information as instance 
// variables—a part number (type String), a part description (type String),
// a quantity of the item being purchased(type int)and a price per item(double).
// Your class should have a constructor that initializes the four instance
// variables. Provide a set and a get method for each instance variable.
// In addition, provide a method named getInvoiceAmount that calculates the
// invoice amount (i.e., multiplies the quantity by the price per item),
// then returns the amount as a double value. 
// If the quantity is not positive, it should be set to 0. 
// If the price per item is not positive, it should be set to 0.0. 
// Write a test application named InvoiceTest that demonstrates class 
// Invoice’s capabilities.
